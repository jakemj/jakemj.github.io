            <td>For my python project, I along with my group, created the game of Nim. We coded our project with some difficulties. One of these difficulties was the conditions of the while loops. We asked our instructor and looked more on the web about while loops and how they exactly work, and we changed the and's to our's to fix our code. Conditions for the if statements were also a problem. We fixed this by adding more specific variables to the assignment. Other than this, we didn't really have to many large problems other than typos for variables, and just typos in the code in general. As for my individual work in the project, I was in charge of writing the variables and making sure the math throughout the code with greater than or less than signs were correct. This was important as one of these typos could have messed up the entirety of the game and it would be unplayable. An oppourtunity that I got from this project was to understand the importance of if statements and the while loop as a whole. The power of these strings can create an interesting game like the game of Nim!
