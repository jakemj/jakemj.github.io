    A career is everything to a person, its what you do everyday! Hi, my name is Jake Mark Johnson. I am 15 years old and am currently attending Palm Desert High School. I love technology ranging from building PC's to filming and editing documentaries. My main goal for my academics is to get two degrees, a major and a minor. I am still not sure about what exactly I want to puruse. However, I know I want to work in the technology field and the buisness spectrum. I plan for this to happen, I am trying hard in school at the moment for long term achievments by graduating college, and for short term achievements like getting a car. However, as for Buisness/Technology, the reason why I chose this was very simple. Ever since I was a little kid I have always loved tech. I had YouTube channels where I would post lego building tutorials for my 15 subscribers. I would edit these videos and this grew me into the person I am today.

     I've always been into personal ideas/tasks. I built my 1st pc about a year ago, and really enjoyed it. This task was not easy as I ran into every problem imaginable from my water cooling not fitting, to not being able to find the correct wires. I persevered through this task. I am also building a computer setup for my little brother at the moment. Also, I love sports (football and basketball mainly). I have a fantasy football team in multiple leagues and love to make "mixtapes" of players. I am also getting into audio production such as making beats, editing them, and assembling it all together. I love to photoshop images (from album covers to family photos), and I have made quite a bit of money doing it for people online.

     Some important achievements that I have so far; good grades in all honors classes, being a swimmer for fun and for my high school, weightlifting/strength conditioning enthusiast, and I fly drones around my family's farm for fun. From my work experience, I learned that I love to do things on my own, and think outside of the box to solve problems. I find unique ways to solve difficult obstacles.
     <br>
     <br>
     To conclude, I would like to thank all of you reading for your time. Building a portfolio website has always been an idea of mine, and I can't believe it is turning into reality. To wrap up everything together, just know that I am a different type of worker. My thoughts on solving issues vary than other people, and I strongly believe I am a one of a kind. My knowledge for technology and buisness aspects are extremely impressive. Regardless, be welcomed to click around this thread, wherever you'd like.
