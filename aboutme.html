    Hi, my name is Jake Mark Johnson. I am 15 years old and am currently
    attending Palm Desert High School.
    I love technology ranging from building PC's
    to filming and editing documentaries. I built my 1st pc
    about a year ago, and really enjoyed it. This task was not
    easy as I ran into every problem imaginable from my water
    cooling not fitting, to not being able to find the correct
    wires. I persevered through this task. I am also building a
    computer setup for my little brother at the moment. Also, I
    love sports (football and basketball mainly). I have a fantasy
    football team in multiple leagues and love to make "mixtapes" of
    players. Im also getting into audio production such as making beats,
    editing them, and assembling it all together. I love to photoshop
    images, and I have made quite a bit of money doing it for people
    online.

    My main goal for my academics is to get two degrees, a major and a minor.
    I am still not sure about
